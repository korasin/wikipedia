        <p>
            My education level is a high school graduate. Had different field to explore before graduation.
            Currently, I have no job experience yet, but looking foward to working in a convinient working space.
            My decision to joining Moringa class was an inspiration from a Moringa alumni.They showed wonderful skills
             and express they in a unbelievable work-string.This is how my thirst to join the class began and more of 
             exploring new skills each dawn.
